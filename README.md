# EMG-Computer-Cursor-Control
An Arduino-based EMG Computer Cursor Control System programmed in C++. This project implements a five-channel system that uses electromyography (EMG) signals from the right arm to control a computer cursor. Muscle contractions drive five distinct actions: left, right, up, down, and click.
